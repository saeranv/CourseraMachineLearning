# Terminology


Supervised learning
- we are given a dataset with "answers given" that is there is a known relationship between output and input. We can map the inputs to a continuous valued function, or a discrete value. Two main types: regression and classification.

Unsupervised learning
- we are given a dataset where we don't know the reltionship between variables, and task algorithm to derive the structure based on this relationships. Two main types: clustering, non-clustering. 

Regression
- predict a continuous valued output

Classification problem:
- discrete valued output (0 or 1)
